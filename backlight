So, just download or clone the source of light:


$ git clone https://github.com/haikarainen/light.git

Compile and install it:


$ sudo make

$ sudo make install

On Fedora 26 and Ubuntu 17.04 all went fine. You can check it:


$ light --help

And, finally, replace the lines of code in the i3wm .config file:


# Screen brightness controls
# bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec xbacklight -inc 20 # increase screen brightness
# bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec xbacklight -dec 20 # decrease screen brightness
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec light -A 5 # increase screen brightness
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec light -U 5 # decrease screen brightness
